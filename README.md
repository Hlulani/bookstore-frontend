This project was meant to read from xml file, due to limited knowledge and time constraits that I have struggled to find enough time because of so much workload this week and the past one I have opted for creating my own spring boot REST API and perfomed CRUD, while I understand that this is not exactly what's is required, I didn't want to delay further.
I sincerely apologize for this and hope I will still stand a better chance for the interview

# This project had two tabs
* Add book - this will give you an option to add book information and save
* Book list - This has 3 options, Deleting a book, updating book and viewing book details
